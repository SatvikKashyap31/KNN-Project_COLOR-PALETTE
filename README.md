# KNN-Project_COLOR-PALETTE
Identify dominant colors from an image using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to generate a color palette.

## Color Palette Identifier using KNN

This project extracts and identifies the dominant colors (color palette) from any image using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It allows users to visualize which colors are most prominent in an image, making it useful for designers, developers, or anyone working with visual content.

## Features

- Extracts dominant colors from an image
- Visualizes color clusters using KNN
- Shows RGB and Hex values of identified colors
- Supports image input via file upload
- Optional: Adjustable number of color clusters

## Algorithm

The project uses a simple implementation of the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) clustering algorithm on image pixel data (RGB values) to group similar colors and extract dominant hues.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for KNN)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
